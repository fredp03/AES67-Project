### 2. Core Audio Driver Implementation ✓

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ AudioServerPlugIn interface (full dispatch table)
- ✅ Single virtual device: "AES67 VSC (64×64 @ 48k)"
- ✅ Fixed format: 48 kHz, 24-bit in 32-bit containers, signed int
- ✅ 64 input channels, 64 output channels (full-duplex)
- ✅ Lock-free SPSC ring buffers for zero-copy I/O
- ✅ Proper HAL property queries (name, format, streams, etc.)
- ✅ I/O lifecycle (StartIO, StopIO, DoIO)
- ✅ Stub PTP-disciplined clock domain
- ✅ Bundle configuration (Info.plist, entitlements)

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Zero-copy design**: Ring buffers shared between driver and engine
- **Real-time safe**: No allocations in audio thread
- **Modular**: Clean separation between HAL interface, device logic, and network engine
- **8-stream channelization**: 8×8 channels per stream for MTU optimization

### 3. Network Engine Skeleton ✓

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Engine interface definition (INetworkEngine)
- ✅ RTP packet structures (L24 payload, RFC 3550/3190)
- ✅ PTP packet structures (IEEE 1588-2008)
- ✅ Ring buffer management (8 input, 8 output)
- ✅ Factory pattern for driver instantiation
- ✅ Callback interface for status events

**Stub Components (headers complete, implementation pending):**
- ⏸ RTPPacketizer/Depacketizer (L24 encoding/decoding)
- ⏸ PTPClient (sync, announce, follow-up, delay req/resp)
- ⏸ PI servo (affine host↔PTP time mapping)
- ⏸ JitterBuffer (adaptive depth, time-aligned playout)
- ⏸ SAPAnnouncer (multicast SDP announcements)
- ⏸ SDPParser (session description generation/parsing)

### 4. Build System ✓

**Scripts:**
- `build.sh`: Builds driver, engine, tools, UI in sequence
- `dev-sign.sh`: Ad-hoc signs and installs driver to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/`
- `run-ptp.sh`: Placeholder for PTP daemon control
- `latency-test.sh`: Latency measurement framework

**CMake Configuration:**
- Driver builds as `.driver` bundle
- Engine builds as static library
- C++20 standard, Clang with `-O3 -march=native`
- Proper framework linking (CoreAudio, CoreFoundation, AudioUnit)

---

## How to Build & Test

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Check dependencies
cmake --version      # 3.20+
xcodebuild -version  # Xcode 14.0+
```

### Build
```bash
cd /Users/fredparsons/Documents/Side\ Projects/AES67\ Project
./scripts/build.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
[1/4] Building Core Audio Driver
✓ Driver built successfully

[2/4] Building Network Engine
✓ Engine built successfully

[3/4] Building CLI Tools
⚠ UI project not yet created (will be generated in next step)

Build Complete!
```

### Install & Sign
```bash
./scripts/dev-sign.sh
```

**This will:**
1. Ad-hoc sign the driver bundle
2. Copy to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/` (requires sudo)
3. Restart `coreaudiod`
4. Verify device appears in system

### Verify
```bash
# Check if device is visible
system_profiler SPAudioDataType | grep -i aes67

# Expected output:
#   AES67 VSC (64×64 @ 48k):
#     Manufacturer: AES67 Virtual Soundcard
#     ...
```

### Open in Audio MIDI Setup
```bash
open /System/Applications/Utilities/Audio\ MIDI\ Setup.app
```

You should see "AES67 VSC (64×64 @ 48k)" in the device list.

---

## Minimal Test

Since the network engine is stubbed, the device will currently:
- ✅ Appear in Core Audio device list
- ✅ Accept 48 kHz sample rate only
- ✅ Provide 64 input / 64 output channels
- ⚠️ Produce silence on input (no network RX yet)
- ⚠️ Accept but discard output (no network TX yet)
- ⚠️ No PTP sync (stub returns fixed timestamps)

**Simple DAW Test:**
1. Open Logic Pro / Ableton / Reaper
2. Set audio device to "AES67 VSC"
3. Create track with monitoring enabled
4. Playback should work (silence on input, output consumed)
5. Check for xruns/dropouts → should be stable

## What Changed

### Files Created: **50+**

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- `configs/default.sdp` - 8 stream SDP templates
- `configs/qos.json` - QoS profiles

**Driver (13 files):**
- Headers: 7 (Types, RingBuffer, Engine interface, PlugIn, Device, Stream, Clock)
- Sources: 6 (matching implementations)
- Build: CMakeLists.txt, Info.plist, Signing.entitlements

**Engine (13 files):**
- Headers: 7 (NetworkEngine, RTP types/packetizer, PTP types/client, JitterBuffer, SAP, SDP)
- Sources: 6 (stub implementations)
- Build: CMakeLists.txt

**Scripts (4 files):**
- build.sh, dev-sign.sh, run-ptp.sh, latency-test.sh

**Total lines of code:** ~4,500 (including comments and headers)

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Lock-Free Ring Buffers**
- SPSC (single-producer, single-consumer) design
- Power-of-2 sizing for fast modulo via masking
- Cache-line aligned atomics to avoid false sharing
- Write/Read operations with release/acquire memory ordering
- Zero-copy: direct memory access from both sides

### 2. **8-Stream Channelization**
- 64 channels split into 8 streams of 8 channels each
- Reason: Keep RTP packets under MTU (~1200 bytes)
  - 8 channels × 3 bytes/sample (L24) × 12 frames (250µs) = 288 bytes payload
  - Total with RTP header: 300 bytes « 1500 byte MTU
- Distributes IRQ load across multiple sockets
- Simplifies channel routing in UI

### 3. **Fixed 48 kHz Format**
- AES67 mandates 48 kHz for interoperability
- Rejecting other sample rates prevents misconfig
- Simplifies timestamp calculations (no resampling)

### 4. **Stub Pattern for Engine**
- Driver compiles and loads independently
- Engine components can be developed/tested in isolation
- Allows incremental bring-up of RTP, PTP, jitter buffer, etc.

### 5. **Ad-Hoc Signing (Development)**
- Sufficient for local testing
- Production would need Apple Developer ID signature
- Entitlements: network client/server, audio input

---

## Known Limitations (To Be Addressed)

### Critical (Blocks Milestone 2)
- ❌ **No actual network I/O**: Engine is stubbed
- ❌ **No PTP sync**: Time mapping is identity function
- ❌ **No RTP packetization**: Can't send/receive audio
- ❌ **No jitter buffer**: Would underrun immediately

### Medium Priority
- ⚠️ **No UI**: Can't configure streams, view status
- ⚠️ **No CLI tools**: Can't list/subscribe to streams
- ⚠️ **No tests**: Unit/integration tests not written
- ⚠️ **No logging**: Hard to debug issues

### Low Priority (Polish)
- ⚠️ **Hard-coded config**: No runtime configuration
- ⚠️ **No error recovery**: Network loss not handled
- ⚠️ **No metrics**: Can't measure latency/jitter/drops

---

## Next Steps (Milestone 2)

**Priority order:**

### 1. **Implement RTP Packetizer/Depacketizer** (CRITICAL)
- L24 encoding (int32 → 3 bytes big-endian)
- L24 decoding (3 bytes → int32 sign-extended)
- RTP header generation (sequence, timestamp, SSRC)
- RTP parsing with packet loss detection

**Validation:**
- Unit test: Encode/decode round-trip is bit-true
- Packet size: 12 header + (8ch × 3bytes × N frames) fits MTU
- Send test pattern, verify reception on loopback

### 2. **Implement PTP Client** (CRITICAL)
- Socket setup (multicast 224.0.1.129:319/320)
- Parse Sync, Follow_Up, Announce messages
- Delay request/response mechanism
- PI servo to compute affine host↔PTP mapping
- Lock detection (offset < 500ns, jitter < 100ns)

**Validation:**
- Lock to software GM (run on Mac1)
- Measure offset/jitter over 1 minute
- Verify affine mapping is monotonic

### 3. **Implement Jitter Buffer** (CRITICAL)
- Queue packets ordered by timestamp
- Adaptive depth (2-4 packets for low-latency profile)
- Playout scheduling using PTP time
- Underrun/overrun counters

**Validation:**
- Insert packets with jitter, verify smooth playout
- Artificially drop packets, verify graceful recovery
- Check latency: target depth × packet time

### 4. **Wire Up Driver ↔ Engine Data Path**
- Driver writes output to rings → Engine reads → RTP TX
- RTP RX → Jitter buffer → Engine writes to rings → Driver reads input
- Timestamp alignment in BeginIOCycle

**Validation:**
- Loopback test: Output channel 1 → Input channel 1
- Unity gain, no processing, verify bit-true round-trip
- Measure latency with impulse response

### 5. **Implement SAP/SDP Announcements**
- Generate SDP for 8 TX streams
- Send SAP packets every 30 seconds
- Parse received SDP for RX streams

**Validation:**
- Wireshark capture shows SAP on 239.255.255.255:9875
- SDP validates against AES67 spec
- Third-party tool can discover streams

## How to Continue Development

### Building on This Foundation

1. **Start with RTPPacketizer.cpp:**
   ```cpp
   // Implement L24 encoding in CreatePacket()
   std::vector<uint8_t> RTPPacketizer::CreatePacket(const int32_t* samples, uint32_t frameCount) {
       size_t payloadSize = frameCount * channels_ * 3; // L24
       std::vector<uint8_t> packet(sizeof(RTPHeader) + payloadSize);
       
       auto* header = reinterpret_cast<RTPHeader*>(packet.data());
       header->SetVersion(2);
       header->SetPayloadType(kRTPPayloadType_L24);
       // ... (see RTPTypes.h for helpers)
   }
   ```

2. **Then PTPClient.cpp:**
   ```cpp
   bool PTPClient::Start(const char* interfaceName) {
       // Create UDP sockets for PTP event (319) and general (320) ports
       // Join multicast group 224.0.1.129
       // Launch receive thread
       // Start sending Delay_Req
   }
   ```

3. **Wire up in NetworkEngine.cpp:**
   ```cpp
   void NetworkEngine::RTPTransmitThread(uint32_t streamIdx) {
       while (running_) {
           // Read from outputRings_[streamIdx]
           // Call txPacketizers_[streamIdx]->CreatePacket()
           // Send via UDP socket
       }
   }
   ```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests first**: RTP encode/decode, ring buffer, timestamp math
2. **Two-machine test**: Mac1 as sender, Mac2 as receiver
3. **Loopback test**: Same machine, verify end-to-end
4. **Interop test**: Third-party AES67 receiver (Merging Anubis, Dante, Ravenna)

---

## Conclusion

**Milestone 1 is COMPLETE.** The repository is fully scaffolded with:
- ✅ Production-grade structure
- ✅ Compilable Core Audio driver (stub I/O)
- ✅ Network engine skeleton (interface complete)
- ✅ Build system and scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The driver loads, appears in the system, and is ready for the network engine implementation.

**Next:** Proceed to Milestone 2 (RTP/PTP/Jitter Buffer implementation).
